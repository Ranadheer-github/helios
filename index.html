        Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamous weak E-Rank hunter,
         he gets the chance of a lifetime when he is selected as the Player of a magical program called the System and gains the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint.
          By taking advantage of this new power offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rises up to become humanity's greatest hunter, 
         but also finds himself locked in a war that has been going on forever between the Rulers and the Monarchs, two groups of godlike beings who have their own agendas with mankind.

        Upon his Reawakening, becoming a Player, Jin-Woo went from a young man with a weaker build into a lean young man<br>
         with a well-developed physique, because the System was assisting in his growth to make him stronger. <br>
         He now became a rather tall and handsome young man able to attract the attention of most woman.
